# Microbial Genomics Journey Workshop 2023
## Session 12: Graduation Project
### Description
* There will be 3 teams (Red, Green and Blue). Each team will work together on a project with certain comparative genomics questions to try to answer. We talked about too many tools and approaches, this project will be the most important part of the workshop as you will be able to apply what you have learnt so far and put it all together.
* The last session will be on 5/10 and each team will present their findings. Next Wednesday you will get more details.
* You can access teh dataset from [Dataset of 50 genomes](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j8fajbwm5cwfy14l9nasc/h?dl=0&rlkey=531bwej0dxzxoq2k04kllthi9).
* There is a fastq folder with 50 genomes and 1 file showing case and control designations.
* Each team will have to present their methods, main commands and major findings on 5/10/2023.
* The teaching team will be happy to answer all your questions.

### Thoughts and Tips
* Go through the material and you will be able to process these isolates from start to finish. You may not use all of the tools.
* The readme file on github with the syllabus has a nice summary for all steps and tools we discussed.
* Team should divide work. For instance, each one assemble 5 genomes...etc, using the same command.

### Questions to answer
These 50 genomes are from a single species. There are two group of isolates (case and control), 25 each. Ypu are provided with fastq reads files.
1. What are the differences between the genomes in the case group vs control group?
2. Build a phylogenetic tree for these 50 genomes. Describe your findings on the tree!
